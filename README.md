# Data Structures

## Introduction

I decided to refresh my understadning of data structures, I studied them in high school and just wanted to refresh my knowledge, In this repository I will explore different data structures, understand their advanatages and backdraws, and their use cases.

## General

**So what is a data structure?**

A data structure is a Node that contains different data types like numbers, chars, strings and these Nodes are stored in the programms memory in a specific way for each data structure type. data structures are used for different reasons like storing data, processing data, and reading data. each data strucutre has its own application, characteristics, and features.

There are different types of data structures when each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. We can divide all the data structures into 2 main categories which are:

- Linear data structures
- Non-Linear data structures

### Linear Data Structures

These types of data structures are stored sequentially which means that the Nodes are connected to each other in some way, depends on the data structure itself. Because they are connected to each other it is possible to run through each of them in a single run, when each Node is accessible only once during that run. In addition for that linear data structures can be divided into 2 sub categories which are **Static** and **Dynamic**

- **Static**: In this type of data structures the memory size is allocated on the compile time, like **Arrays** with a given length.
- **Dynamic**: In this type of data Strucutres the memory size is allocated dynamically during the runtime, like **Linked Lists**.

**List of Linear Data Structures**:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Stacks

### Non-Linear Data Structure

Theses types of data structures are **NOT** stored sequentially, it is not possible to go through every element in a single run, and Nodes are connected to more than 2 Nodes or not connected at all.

**List of Non-Linear Data Structure**

- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

## Arrays

Arrays are a built in data strucutre in every programming language, array is a collection of values with an index that are stored in a contiguous way in the memory, arrays types and the way they worked are different according to the programming language that is used. For example in **C** arrays are static, and can contain a single data type. But in modern languages like **JavaScript** arrays can contain multiple types of different data types and a non-fixed size.

**Static** - In that case static arrays are fixed size which is determined at compile time.

**Dynamic** - Dynamic arrays are defined without a fixed length for example with the word `new` and the size is determined at runtime.

Arrays provide an efficient way of accessing values due to the contiguous way of storage in the memory. Because arrays are built in, they are used to implement different data structures like trees, or linked lists.

It is very important to remember that every programming language has its own array properties.
