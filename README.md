# Data Structures

## Introduction

I decided to refresh my understadning of data structures, I studied them in high school and just wanted to refresh my knowledge, In this repository I will explore different data structures, understand their advanatages and backdraws, and their use cases.

## General

**So what is a data structure?**

A data structure is a group of Nodes that contain different data types like numbers, chars, strings and these Nodes are stored in the programms memory in a specific way for each data structure. data structures are used for different reasons like storing data, processing data, and reading data. each data strucutre has its own application, characteristics, and features.

There are different types of data structures when each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. We can divide all the data structures into 2 main sub categories which are:

- Linear data structures
- Non-Linear data structures

### Linear Data Structures

These types of data structures are stored sequentially which means that the Nodes are connected to each other in some way, depends on the data structure itself. Because they are connected to each other it is possible to run through each of them in a single run, when each Node is accessible only once during that run. In addition for that linear data structures can be divided into 2 sub categories which are **Static** and **Dynamic**

- **Static**: In this type of data structures the memory size is allocated on the initial step, like **Arrays** with a given length.
- **Dynamic**: In this type of data Strucutres the memory size is allocated dynamically during the runtime of a programm, like **Linked Lists**.

**List of Linear Data Structures**:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Stacks

### Non-Linear Data Structure

Theses types of data structures are **NOT** stored sequentially, it is not possible to go through every element in a single run, and Nodes are connected to more than 2 Nodes or not connected at all.

**List of Non-Linear Data Structure**

- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
